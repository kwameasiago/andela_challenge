GETTING STARTED
These instruction will help you understand the user interface for the Bizna System/WeConnect

PREREQUISITES
If interested in improvement of this system knowledge on Flask , Flask Restplus, Bootstrap ,HTML and CSS will be an added advantage

APPROACH
I opted to use a simpe User interface that will not be a taskfull to the normal user

INSTALLING
To install the user interface for Bizna just copy the files as they are. For further understanding check the file structure pdf file located in the mock up folder

To run the the API simply ensure that you have all the requirement found in the Requirement.txt. set up a virtual enviroment and run the the app.py file found in API folder

NB 
The boostrap file is edited ie if you link it to a online boostrap file it might affect the design.
The favicon style sheet are linked to an online file so you have to be connected to the internet to view them

It is recomended that you install the requirement in you virtual enviroment

RUNNING TEST
There are no test that are carried out this stage
To run the api activate your virtual enviroment and run the file named app.py
